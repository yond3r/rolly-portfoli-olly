            <div>
                <p>Hello there! I'm Jovi, and I'm a designer turned developer. My program of choice is Adobe Illustrator, but I've also got somewhat of a hand in Adobe Photoshop, among other things, like Procreate. Aside from digital, I also work in traditional mediums, specifically ink and charcoal. </p>
                <p>My favorite professor once said that I had an eye for the colorful, and the brains to match. I'm not entirely certain as to what he meant by that, but I can only assume it is a good thing. So with my brain, I decided to take a dive into the developing side. I have learned so much this far, and I only hope I can keep growing and thriving.</p>
